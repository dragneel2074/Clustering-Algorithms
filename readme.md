## Key Performance Table

| Algorithm                | Silhouette Score | Configuration                               | Key Insights                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **K-Means**              | **0.122**        | k = 9                                       | Provides clear segmentation into 9 clusters; best for well-separated, spherical clusters but sensitive to initialization. |
| **DBSCAN**               | **0.129**        | eps = 2.0, min_samples = 5 (18 clusters)      | Detects arbitrarily shaped clusters and outliers; high noise proportion can be a drawback.                        |
| **GMM**                  | **0.122**        | 9 components (selected via AIC/BIC)         | Offers probabilistic clustering with interpretable segments assuming Gaussian distributions; struggles with non-Gaussian data. |
| **K-means++**            | **0.122**        | k = 9 with k-means++ initialization         | Improves initialization for more stable results; still assumes spherical clusters.                                |
| **Mini-batch K-Means**   | **0.091**        | k = 9 using mini-batches                      | Scales to large datasets with faster computation but at the cost of slightly lower clustering accuracy.            |
| **Bisecting K-Means**     | **0.100**        | k = 9 using recursive splitting             | Reveals hierarchical structure; effective for natural splits but sensitive to the initial split decisions.         |
| **Fuzzy C-means**        | **-0.055**       | Default fuzzy parameters                     | Allows soft, overlapping clusters; computationally intensive and sensitive to noise.                               |
| **HDBSCAN**              | **0.137**        | min_cluster_size = 5, min_samples = 25        | Handles clusters of varying densities well; requires careful tuning and may yield many noise points.               |
| **OPTICS** (Too many data in -1, unrealiable)              | **0.603**        | min_samples = 10, xi = 0.05, min_cluster_size = 10 | Captures complex cluster structures without a fixed radius; output can be challenging to interpret.                |
| **DBSCAN++**             | **0.132**        | Automated parameter selection                | Enhances DBSCAN with improved parameter selection; still sensitive to noise and settings.                          |

## Summary of Insights

- **K-Means & GMM:** Yield clear, interpretable segments (9 clusters) but assume spherical or Gaussian distributions.
- **DBSCAN & Variants:** Excel at detecting irregular cluster shapes and outliers, though they often produce high noise levels.
- **Scalable Methods:** Mini-batch and Bisecting K-Means offer efficiency for large datasets with slight accuracy trade-offs.
- **Fuzzy C-means:** Useful for overlapping clusters; however, its computational cost and noise sensitivity can limit practicality.
- **OPTICS:** Provides detailed insights into complex cluster structures but can be difficult to interpret directly.

## Conclusion
Choose the algorithm based on your objectives:
- **For clear, well-separated clusters:** Use K-Means, GMM, or K-means++.
- **For irregular shapes and outlier detection:** Consider DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, or DBSCAN++.
- **For large-scale data:** Mini-batch or Bisecting K-Means are efficient choices.
- **For overlapping clusters:** Fuzzy C-means offers flexibility despite higher computational costs.
